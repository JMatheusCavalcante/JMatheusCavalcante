    <h1>Hi there, what do you want to know about me?! 👋</h1>
    <p>
      QA Analyst with a strong background in software development. Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a deep understanding of all phases of software development. My journey from development to QA has given me a unique perspective on building and testing software, allowing me to bridge the gap between code creation and quality assurance effectively. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills through personal projects.

      👨🏻‍💻 My best language: JavaScript<br>
      🧠 But I know too: TypeScript, SQL, and I'm familiar with Python and Robot Framework for test automation.<br>
      📦 And frameworks? React, Node.js, Selenium... there's a lot to discuss, so feel free to reach out!<br>
      🔥 Topics of interest: Software quality assurance, test automation, frontEnd development, and new tools to improve software reliability.<br>
      💬 Ask me about test automation, QA practices, and how to improve software quality.
