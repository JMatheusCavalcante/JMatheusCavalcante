      <h1>Hi there, Im Matheus! 👋</h1>
      <p>
        QA Analyst with a strong background in software development.<br>
        Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in<br>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a deep understanding<br>
        of all phases of software development. My journey from<br>
        development to QA has given me a unique perspective on<br>
        building and testing software, allowing me to bridge<br>
        the gap between code creation and quality assurance<br>
        effectively. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my<br>
        skills through personal projects.
      </p>
 
👨🏻‍💻 My best language: JavaScript<br>


🧠 But I know too: TypeScript, SQL, and I'm familiar with Python and Robot Framework for test automation.<br>

📦 And frameworks? React, Node.js, Selenium... there's a lot to discuss, so feel free to reach out!<br>
       
🔥 Topics of interest: Software quality assurance, test automation, frontEnd development, and new tools to improve software reliability.<br>

💬 Ask me about test automation and how to improve software quality.
