<p>
  QA Analyst with a strong background in software development.<br>
  Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in<br>
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a deep understanding<br> 
  of all phases of software development. My journey from<br>
  development to QA has given me a unique perspective on<br>
  building and testing software, allowing me to bridge<br>
  the gap between code creation and quality assurance<br>
  effectively. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my<br>
  skills through personal projects.<br>




  👨🏻‍💻 My best language: JavaScript


  🧠 But I know too: TypeScript, SQL, and I'm familiar with Python and Robot Framework for test automation.
  
  📦 And frameworks? React, Node.js, Selenium... there's a lot to discuss, so feel free to reach out!
  
  🔥 Topics of interest: Software quality assurance, test automation, frontEnd development, and new tools to improve software reliability.
  
  💬 Ask me about test automation, QA practices, and how to improve software quality.
