    QA Analyst with a strong background in software development. Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a deep understanding of all phases of software development. My journey from development to QA has given me a unique perspective on building and testing software, allowing me to bridge the gap between code creation and quality assurance effectively. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills through personal projects.
