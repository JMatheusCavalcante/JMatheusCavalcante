QA Analyst with a strong background in software development. Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a deep understanding of all phases of software development. My journey from development to QA has given me a unique perspective on building and testing software, allowing me to bridge the gap between code creation and quality assurance effectively. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills through personal projects


👨🏻‍💻 My best language: JavaScript

🧠 But I know too: TypeScript, SQL, and I'm familiar with Phyton and Robot Framework for test automation.

📦 And frameworks ? React, Node.js, Selenium... there's a lot to discuss, so feel free to reach out!

🔥 Topics of interest: Software quality assurance, test automation, frontEnd development and  new tools to improve software reliability.

💬 Ask me about test automation, QA practices, and how to improve software quality.
